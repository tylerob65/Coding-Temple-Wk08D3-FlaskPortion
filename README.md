## The Assignment

Build an e-commerce application with the following things to be included:

- A user should be able to sign up
- A route that shows a list of all available products
- When you click on a product it should be able to link to a route which shows a single product (with the information of the product you just clicked)
- User should be able to add a product to their cart, but only if they are logged in
- A route (cart) that shows a list of products youâ€™ve added into your cart as well as the total of all the items in your cart
- Add a route that, when clicked handles functionality that removes all items from your cart one time. Also create a button that, when pressed, it removes that specific product object from the cart.
